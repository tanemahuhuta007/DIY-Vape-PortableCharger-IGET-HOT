## Parts and Tools

### Parts
- Old vape (preferably non-functional)  
- 18650 battery or similar (depending on the vape's capacity)  
- TP4056 module (battery charger with over-discharge protection)  
- Micro USB or Type-C female port  
- Wires (22 AWG recommended)  
- Optional: On/Off switch  

### Tools
- Soldering iron  
- Screwdrivers  
- Wire cutters/strippers  
- Multimeter

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Disassemble the Vape
- Carefully open the vape and remove internal components while keeping the housing intact.

### 2. Prepare the Battery
- Test the 18650 battery to ensure it’s functional and safe.  
- If your vape already has a usable battery, test it for capacity and safety.

### 3. Install the TP4056 Module
- Solder the battery terminals to the input of the TP4056 module.  
- Connect the module's output to your USB port.  

### 4. Reassemble the Housing
- Fit all components securely inside the vape housing.  
- Optionally, add an on/off switch for better control.  

### 5. Test the Charger
- Use a multimeter to verify the output voltage (should be 5V for USB devices).  
- Test the charging functionality with a small device.
